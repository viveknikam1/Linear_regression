# Linear_regression
Linear regression to predict salary based on years of experience.
About Dataset:
Dataset is having two columns
"YearsExperience"
"Salary"
Here "Salary" id dependent variable, need to predict based on "YearsExperience".
I have used Linear regression because data seems tobe linearly distributed.
Accuracy score I got here is about 95%.
